Go to the the project directory in shell, and type make
This compiles a runnable program by the name example_prog
The program uses printout capturing library, where it calls a function of the library 
with the parameter "testaustiedosto" and prints stuff in the main and child process, as well in threads.
These prints should be captured in the textfile.
The library itself can be found in the file "output_capture.c". Calling the librarys function "capture_stdout" opens a txtfile
given as a parameter and writes all stdout to it.
